Write a bash script to take the input from "final.txt" you made in Task2.
Now take md5sum of each character and put it in another file named "decrypt_it".

Since "decrypt_it" may be very large. So, you can take first half or less from final.txt in real time.
File size may vary from 2 MB to 10 MB.

"decrypt_it" is for demo puposes only.
